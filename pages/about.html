        <h1>The Departure of Me?</h1>
        <p>What deos the <strong>"The Departure of Me"</strong>mean exactly.
        Well for me it is taking out the old and bringing in the new. The state of being 
    in constant self judgement, letting the judgemnet of others run my narritive, telling me 
I cannot do somethig before I even get started. I am sick of it Im <em>done</em>.</p>
        
        <p><em>How does the self improvement begin?</em>Well, this webpage! This a personal project of 
            mine while I teach myself how to code. This webpage will not only be about my coding journey. 
            It will also have updates about two other major milestones I want to acheive as well.
            The purpose of this page is to show the footprints towards my own self devolpment, as time goes
            on the webpage will evolve and update as I acheive the milestones I have put out for myself.
