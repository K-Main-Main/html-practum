        <h1>The Departure of Me?</h1>
        <p>What does the <strong>"The Departure of Me"</strong>mean exactly.
        Well for me it is taking out the old and bringing in the new. The state of being 
    in constant self judgement, letting the judgement of others run my narrative, telling me 
I cannot do something before I even get started. I am sick of it Im <em>done</em>.</p>
        
        <p><em>How does the self improvement begin?</em>Well, this webpage! This a personal project of 
            mine while I teach myself how to code. This webpage will not only be about my coding journey. 
            It will also have updates about two other major milestones I want to achieve as well.
            The purpose of this page is to show the footprints towards my own self development, as time goes
            on the webpage will evolve and update as I achieve these milestones I have put out for myself.
